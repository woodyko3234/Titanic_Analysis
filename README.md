When I watched the movie "Titanic" twenty years ago, I had wondered whether most survivors were women and children. Today, thanks to this project, I can figure it out. Also, I'm interested in finding out whether the richer with a first class ticket had a higher chance of survival compared to the other 2 classes. Finally, I wanted to analyze how ticket price index differs in 3 different cities. I will focus on the data I retrieved from https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/September/57e9a84c_titanic-data/titanic-data.csv (data description reference: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data ), which contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. So, here are my questions:
1. What proportion of total survivors are women?
2. Is the survival rate of children (under 12) higher than the others?
3. Did the passengers of first class have a higher chance of survival compared to the other 2 classes and the crew?
4. How did the price index differ in 3 different cities? In other words, how many tickets of class 3 could be bought if we paid the price of class 1 in 3 different cities?
